# NAME

trrr - search torrents 

# DESCRIPTION

CLI tool to search torrents. Results are sorted by number of seeders and each is mapped to key. Pressing the key with assigned letter will open magnet link in your default client. On iOS, magnet link is placed into clipboard.

# INSTALLATION

git clone https://github.com/z448/trrr
cd trrr
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
```

# USAGE

Search with as many parameters as needed.

> `trrr keyword1 keyword2 keywordN`

On Linux, start it without any parameter and it'll use clipboard content as keywords. ( needs 'xclip' or 'xsel' to be installed )

> `trrr`

Limit results which have at least 100 seeders.

> `trrr keyword1 keyword2 keywordN -100`

To get another torrent from previous search add key as parameter. This is mandatory on Windows running 'Git/Bash for Windows' where you have to specify key on CLI upfront.
