VERSION

    This document describes trrr version 0.21

DESCRIPTION

    Tool for searching torrents. Results are sorted by number of seeders
    and each is mapped to keyboard key. Pressing the key will open magnet
    link in your default torrent client. On iOS magnet link is placed into
    clipboard instead.

USAGE

    - Search with as many keywords as needed.

      trrr keyword1 keyword2 keywordN

    - trrr uses source option from '~/.trrr' conf. To use different torrent
    source add one of the following options.

      -p piratebay

      -y yts

      -k kickasstorrents

      -x 1337x

      -l limetorrents

    - start it without any parameter and it'll use clipboard content as
    keywords. ( this needs 'xclip' or 'xsel' to be installed on Linux )

      trrr

    - To automaticaly open some magnet link from results add its key -[A-O]
    as an option. E.g: to open first (A) magnet link use following command.

      trrr keyword1 keyword2 keywordN -A

    On Windows running 'Git/Bash for Windows' you have to specify key
    upfront so first make search without any option to see the results,
    then repeat the command and add key -[A-O] as an option.

    - To see help use -h option.
